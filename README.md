## About 
 In this website we provide the user with the ability to search for and find covid data for each of the states in the United States of America.  By putting in which state they want to look at, they will be able to see the current data as well as the historical data over the last 7 months.  This will allow for people to more easily examine the data for themselves instead of taking summaries from other sources.
